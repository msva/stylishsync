<b>KNOWN ISSUES</b>
<ul>
<li>There has been a problem with new installations in Firefox 19 and later, which cause Stylish Sync to fail initializing. Upgrading from existing installations did work, though. This was fixed in <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/stylishsync/versions/'>version 0.1.6</a>.</li>
<li>Due to recent changes in Mozilla's Sync-Engine, this add-on did not work with some nightlies (Firefox 19 and SeaMonkey 2.16). This was fixed in <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/stylishsync/versions/'>version 0.1.5</a>.</li>
